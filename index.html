            <hr/>
            <p>
                Ever since the <a
                    href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/industrial-revolution-and-technology/#:~:text=The%20Industrial%20Revolution%20was%20the%20transition%20from%20creating%20goods%20by,from%20about%201760%20to%201840.">Industrial
                Revolution</a>, energy usage has grown exponentially. Higher-grade fuels such as coal, oil, and natural
                gas replaced cheap biomass fuels (such as timber and peat) since they produce higher energy yields.</p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/amazon.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="219"/></span>
            <p>
                While coal, oil, and natural gas are great for producing energy, they harm our environment. These three
                sources of energy, known as fossil fuels, are <a
                    href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#:~:text=The%20largest%20source%20of%20greenhouse,electricity%2C%20heat%2C%20and%20transportation.">notorious
                for releasing vast amounts</a> of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our forests cannot pull carbon
                dioxide out of the air as fast as it accumulates.</p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/burn.jpg" alt=""/></span>
            <p>
                As carbon dioxide accumulates into the atmosphere, more infrared radiation is reflected to the Earth,
                causing substantial temperature increases. As the climate increases, a phenomenon known as
                <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/global-warming-vs-climate-change/#:~:text=Global%20warming%20is%20the%20long,the%20term%20%22climate%20change.%22">global
                    warming</a>
                occurs, causing water loss, which may lead to species loss and unintentional forest fires.</p>

            <hr/>
            <p>Carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas, has increased exponentially in the past couple of years,
                causing global warming.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                Contrary to fossil fuel burning for power, <a
                    href="https://www.britannica.com/science/deforestation">clear-cutting</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/slash-and-burn-agriculture">slash-and-burn</a>
                techniques are another cause
                of global warming. These techniques, known as deforestation, remove or burn forests to make room for
                agriculture, urbanization, or landfills. Deforestation is a massive problem because it removes natural
                carbon dioxide sequesters (plants and trees) and releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from
                timber combustion.
            </p>
            <p>If everyone worked harder to become more energy sustainable, we could reverse the adverse side effects of
                global warming. Using energy more efficiently and only when needed would reduce the usage of fossil
                fuels, lessening the amount of greenhouse gases produced that reflect solar radiation to Earth.
                Furthermore, if we practiced more waste-reduction techniques such as composting, we could decrease
                deforestation as fewer landfills are required. Together, we can all stop global warming.

            <a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Photovoltaic_cell">Source: Photovoltaic Cell</a>
            <hr/>
            <p>The best solutions include switching to renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic cells
                (solar energy), ground-source heat pumps (geothermal energy), or tidal energy (water power); however,
                some of these solutions are too expensive for the typical person to switch to.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p>Depending on the household, the most common strategies being implemented
                for increasing sustainability include:</p>
            <h3 class="minor"><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Less Lighting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This may seem obvious, but people still accidentally leave their lights on at night.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="minor"><i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Less Heating</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/natural-gas">Natural gas</a> is the most common fossil
                    fuel for heating. Heating is costly (in terms of electricity). It also provides only a temporary
                    effect (as heat dissipates quickly in buildings).
                </li>
                <li>So the next time you turn the thermostat up, consider if you need it.
                    Try wearing a jacket or sweater or taking a quick warm shower instead.
                </li>

                    16 times more energy</a> to produce compared to crops. Reducing your
                    intake of crops will reduce the consumption of energy-intensive foods.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Compared to driving alone, <a
                        href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/docs/PublicTransportationsRoleInRespondingToClimateChange2010.pdf">Public
                    transportation</a> reduces greenhouse gas production by magnitudes
                    from less gas consumed per person.
                </li>
                <li>Use buses, trains, and carpools.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="minor"><i class="fa-solid fa-tree"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;More Green Structures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Building <a href="https://greenroofs.org/">green roofs</a> can increase albedo (reflection of
                    sunlight) while
                    providing shade and reducing overall air temperatures (reducing energy required for air
                    conditioning).
                </li>
                <li>Building rain gardens can help collect rainwater, preventing excess
                    runoff into storm drains and also improve the quality of life.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="minor"><i class="fa-solid fa-recycle"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;More Recycling / Composting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Recycling glass bottles, paper, or some forms of plastic allows them to be
                    reused rather than end up in landfills, reducing the overall waste produced.
                </li>
                <li>Composting prevents food scraps or other compostable materials from ending up in landfill, where
                    they will take longer to decompose. Composted material can act as garden soil and fertilizer.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <hr/>
            <p>Overall, here are some of the simple solutions you can implement to increase sustainability. However,
                globally, we must work to seek more long-term solutions to address the damages we have already
                caused.</p>

            <p>Long-term solutions include countries switching to more renewable sources of energy. While renewable
                sources of energy have their pros and cons, they do not deplete fossil fuel reserves and do not release
