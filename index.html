            <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Source: Our World In Data</a>
            <hr/>
            <p>Ever since the <a
                    href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/industrial-revolution-and-technology/#:~:text=The%20Industrial%20Revolution%20was%20the%20transition%20from%20creating%20goods%20by,from%20about%201760%20to%201840.">Industrial
                Revolution</a>, energy usage has grown exponentially. Traditionally,
                cheap biomass fuels such as timber and peat were burned to create raw energy; however, higher-grade
                fuels
                such as coal, oil, and natural gas have since replaced them as they are more efficient. </p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/amazon.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="219"/></span>
            <p>While coal, oil, and natural gas are great for producing energy, they aren't great for
                our environment. These three sources of energy, known as fossil fuels, are <a
                        href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#:~:text=The%20largest%20source%20of%20greenhouse,electricity%2C%20heat%2C%20and%20transportation.">notorious
                    for releasing huge amounts</a> of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our forests are unable to
                pull carbon dioxide out of the air as fast enough as they are being added. </p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/burn.jpg" alt=""/></span>
            <p>As a result of carbon dioxide accumulating into the atmosphere, more infrared radiation
                is reflected back to the Earth, causing huge temperature increases. As the climate increases,
                a phenomenon known as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/desertification">desertification</a>
                is increased, causing water loss, which may lead to
                species loss and unintentional forest fires.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p>If everyone worked harder to become more sustainable, the negative side effects of global warming
                could be reversed. Using energy more efficiently and only when we need to would reduce the usage
                of fossil fuels, lessening the amount of greenhouse gases produced that reflect solar radiation
                back to Earth. We could stop fires, habitat loss, and extinction of species if we took action.</p>

            <a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Photovoltaic_cell">Source: Photovoltaic Cell</a>
            <hr/>
            <p>The best solutions include switching to renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic cells
                (solar energy), ground-source heat pumps (geothermal energy), or tidal energy (water power); however,
                some of these solutions are too expensive for the common person to switch to.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p>Depending on your household, here are the most common strategies for increasing sustainability:</p>
            <h3 class="minor"><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Less Lighting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This may seem obvious, but people still accidentally leave their lights on during the night.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="minor"><i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Less Heating</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/natural-gas">Natural gas</a> is the most common fossil
                    fuel for heating. Heating is extremely
                    expensive (in terms of electricity), and provides only a temporary effect (as heat
                    is lost in buildings very quickly).
                </li>
                <li>So the next time you turn the thermostat up, think about if you really need it.
                    Maybe try putting on a jacket or sweater, or even taking a quick warm shower instead.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="minor"><i class="fa-solid fa-drumstick-bite"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Less Meat</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Meat requires on average <a
                        href="https://michaelbluejay.com/veg/environment.html#:~:text=Livestock%20production%20requires%20enormous%20amounts%20of%20energy.&text=The%20main%20reason%20is%20that,can%20waste%20them%20on%20livestock.">
                    16 times more energy</a> to produce compared to crops. Reducing your
                    intake of crops will reduce the consumption of energy intensive foods.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="minor"><i class="fa-solid fa-bus"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;More Public Transportation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/docs/PublicTransportationsRoleInRespondingToClimateChange2010.pdf">Public
                        transportation</a> allows many people to ride on a single vehicle, meaning less
                    gas is used per person. Compared to driving alone, this reduces greenhouse gas
                    production by magnitudes.
                </li>
                <li>Use buses, trains, carpools, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="minor"><i class="fa-solid fa-tree"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;More Green Structures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Building <a href="https://greenroofs.org/">green roofs</a> can increase albedo (reflection of
                    sunlight), while also
                    providing shade and reducing overall air temperatures.
                </li>
                <li>Building rain gardens can help collect rain water, preventing any excess
                    runoff into storm drains and also improve the quality of life.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="minor"><i class="fa-solid fa-recycle"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;More Recycling / Composting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Recycling glass bottles, paper, or some forms of plastic allow them to be
                    reused rather than end up in landfills. This allows you to reduce the overall
                    waste output of your household.
                </li>
                <li>Composting allows you to reduce food scraps or other compostable materials from
                    ending in the landfill, where they will take longer to decompose. You can use the
                    composted material for garden soil, fertilizer, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <hr/>
            <p>Overall, here are some of the simple solutions you can implement to increase sustainability. However,
                globally, we must work to seek more long-term solutions to address the damages we have already
                caused.</p>

            <p>Long term solutions include countries switching to more renewable sources of energy. While renewable
                sources of energy have their own pros and cons, they don't deplete fossil fuel reserves and don't
                release greenhouse gases.</p>
